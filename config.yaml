# Personal Life Decision-Support System (PL-DSS) Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This file defines all thresholds, rules, and recovery conditions for the
# decision-support system. Adjust these values to match your personal needs.
#
# The system evaluates your state based on three inputs:
#   1. Fixed deadlines in the next 14 days (non-movable commitments)
#   2. Active high-load domains (work projects, family crises, health issues)
#   3. Energy scores for the last 3 days (1=lowest, 5=highest)
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THRESHOLDS: Define when state transitions occur
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
thresholds:
  # OVERLOAD THRESHOLDS
  # The system enters OVERLOADED state when 2 or more of these conditions are true:
  #   - fixed_deadlines_14d >= threshold
  #   - active_high_load_domains >= threshold
  #   - average energy score <= threshold
  # The system enters STRESSED state when exactly 1 condition is true.
  overload:
    fixed_deadlines_14d: 3        # Trigger: 3+ non-movable deadlines in next 2 weeks
    active_high_load_domains: 3   # Trigger: 3+ life domains requiring high cognitive load
    avg_energy_score: 2           # Trigger: Average energy <= 2 (on 1-5 scale)
  
  # RECOVERY THRESHOLDS
  # The system allows recovery to NORMAL when ALL of these conditions are true:
  #   - fixed_deadlines_14d <= threshold
  #   - active_high_load_domains <= threshold
  #   - average energy score >= threshold
  # These are intentionally stricter than overload thresholds to prevent yo-yo behavior.
  recovery:
    fixed_deadlines_14d: 1        # Recovery: 1 or fewer deadlines remaining
    active_high_load_domains: 2   # Recovery: 2 or fewer high-load domains active
    avg_energy_score: 4           # Recovery: Average energy >= 4 (sustained high energy)

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# DOWNGRADE RULES: Behavioral constraints for each state
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These rules are displayed when you're in STRESSED or OVERLOADED state.
# They serve as pre-defined guidelines to prevent collapse.
# Customize these to match your personal boundaries and priorities.
downgrade_rules:
  # OVERLOADED STATE RULES
  # When 2+ overload conditions are met, follow these rules strictly:
  OVERLOADED:
    - "No new commitments"
    - "Pause technical tool development"
    - "Creative work reduced to minimum viable expression"
    - "Administrative work: only non-delegable tasks"
  
  # STRESSED STATE RULES
  # When exactly 1 overload condition is met, use caution:
  STRESSED:
    - "Warning: approaching overload"
    - "Discourage new projects"
    - "Suggest creating time buffers"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# RECOVERY ADVICE: Messages shown when recovery is possible
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These messages are displayed when all recovery conditions are met.
# They provide positive reinforcement that it's safe to return to normal mode.
recovery_advice:
  - "Deadlines have cleared"
  - "High-load domains have reduced"
  - "Energy levels have stabilized"

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# AUTHORITY DERIVATION: PLO Layer permissions based on Decision Core state
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These rules define what the Planning Engine (L1) and Execution Layer (L2)
# are allowed to do based on the Decision Core's state evaluation.
# 
# Permissions:
#   - planning: ALLOWED | DENIED (whether Planning Engine can propose plans)
#   - execution: ALLOWED | DENIED (whether Execution Layer can run automation)
#   - mode: NORMAL | CONTAINMENT | RECOVERY (operational mode)
#
# Safety-first design: execution is ALWAYS DENIED in this system version.
authority_derivation:
  # OVERLOADED STATE: Deny all planning and execution
  OVERLOADED:
    planning: DENIED
    execution: DENIED
    mode: CONTAINMENT
  
  # STRESSED STATE: Deny all planning and execution
  STRESSED:
    planning: DENIED
    execution: DENIED
    mode: CONTAINMENT
  
  # NORMAL STATE: Allow planning, but execution still denied
  NORMAL:
    planning: ALLOWED
    execution: DENIED  # Always denied in this version
    mode: NORMAL
